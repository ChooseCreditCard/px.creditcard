      <h2>What is a Crypto Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A crypto credit card looks and behaves like a normal Visa, Mastercard or similar, but is connected to a crypto wallet or exchange account. At the point of sale, your crypto is converted to fiat currency, which is used to settle the transaction with the card network.</p>
      <p>Most products are not truly “on-chain at checkout”. Instead, the issuer or partner exchange sells a small amount of your crypto in real time or in batched lots, then uses fiat rails for settlement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How CryptoPay Transactions Flow</h2>
      <p>When you tap or insert the card, the terminal sends a standard authorization request. Behind the scenes, the issuer or partner platform checks your crypto balance, reserves funds, converts to fiat and approves or declines the transaction.</p>
      <p>Conversion may use a spot-rate at the time of purchase, plus a spread and possible extra fees. Some products convert proactively (preload), while others convert “just in time” for each transaction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Spreads and Hidden Costs</h2>
      <p>Crypto cards can include exchange spreads, FX margins, network fees and issuer fees. Many marketing pages highlight rewards but downplay spreads on conversion, which can easily exceed 2–3% depending on liquidity and volatility.</p>
      <p>Always read the fee schedule: look for explicit crypto-conversion fees, FX fees for foreign transactions, ATM withdrawal fees and any additional service charges from the linked exchange.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards, Cashbacks and Token Incentives</h2>
      <p>Rewards may be paid as cash, points or native platform tokens. Some issuers offer higher rates when you stake a token or hold a minimum balance, but this concentrates risk in a single ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Compare rewards after fees: a 3% token reward is less attractive if you are losing 2–3% on spreads and FX every time you use the card.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Volatility and Tax Considerations</h2>
      <p>Every time you convert crypto to fiat you may trigger a taxable event in your jurisdiction. That means daily spending could generate a large number of small taxable disposals.</p>
      <p>Volatility can also work against you. If the market moves sharply between loading and spending, the real purchasing power of your holdings changes — regardless of the headline reward rate.</p>
